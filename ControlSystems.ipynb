        "## Introduction\n",
        "In this tutorial, I will attempt to provide you with a solid understanding of how varying levels of control systems work. Explanations will be accompanied by example programs aimed to set a precedent for how these systems can be implemented in the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Challenge. Topics mentioned later in this notebook will build upon topics mentioned before, so it is important to read, run, and understand the code provided before moving on to the next section.\n",

        "## Background\n",
        "Before we move on to the main topic (control systems), I just want to mention briefly some prerequisites for getting the most of this code. While the philosophy of control systems is independent of the specific feedback (sensors) you are using when building your car, and I am not fully aware of what the specifications of the car you have assembled are, I will make use of some common sensors well-suited to this application. Those sensors and some boilerplate code for how to operate them will be provided below. ALso, as a disclaimer, I know that you are using the BBC micro:bit processor so the code I am writting pertaining to sensor control is written in MicroPython and may will not run in this notebook. And regardless we won't be able to interact with any actual sensors in here so I created some 'mock' functions where I just stub out fake feedback.\n",

It typically consists of a shaft with a rotating wheel, which has slots or markings on it that pass by a sensor, generating pulses that can be counted to determine the distance traveled. In most cases, the markings on the wheel are magnets and the sensor they pass by is a Hall magnetic effect sensor (which will detect the presence of a magnetic field).\n",

However, looking at the instructions for this years competition it doesn't seem to be a factor.
