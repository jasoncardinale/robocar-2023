    "# Control Systems\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, I will attempt to provide you with a solid understanding of how varying levels of control systems work. Explanations will be accompanied by example programs aimed to set a precedent for how these systems can be implemented in the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Challenge. Topics mentioned later in this notebook will build upon topics mentioned before, so it is important to read, run, and understand the code provided before moving on to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Before we move on to the main topic (control systems), I just want to mention briefly some prerequisites for getting the most of this code. While the philosophy of control systems is independent of the specific feedback (sensors) you are using when building your car, and I am not fully aware of what the specifications of the car you have assembled are, I will make use of some common sensors well-suited to this application. Those sensors and some boilerplate code for how to operate them will be provided below. ALso, as a disclaimer, I know that you are using the BBC micro:bit processor so the code I am writting pertaining to sensor control is written in MicroPython and may will not run in this notebook. And regardless we won't be able to interact with any actual sensors in here so I created some 'mock' functions where I just stub out fake feedback.\n",

    "## Photoresistors\n",
    "Photoresistors are electronic components that change their resistance based on the amount of light that they are exposed to. By measuring the resistance of a photoresistor, you can determine the amount of light that is currently hitting it. The more light present, the more conductive the resistor will be. The less light, the more resistive. However, to be clear, we are not measuring resistance over the I/O ports of the board. read_anolog() will tell us the voltage levels across the port. So this means, the more light present -> the more conductive the resistor -> the high voltage across the component -> the higher our readings will be. Therefore, when a reading is comparatively low, we are detecting less light (like from the black lines on the track).\n"

    "A rotary encoder is a device that converts the rotation of a shaft into a digital signal. It typically consists of a shaft with a rotating wheel, which has slots or markings on it that pass by a sensor, generating pulses that can be counted to determine the distance traveled. In most cases, the markings on the wheel are magnets and the sensor they pass by is a Hall magnetic effect sensor (which will detect the presence of a magnetic field).\n",

However, looking at the instructions for this years competition it doesn't seem to be a factor. Be that as it may, it is still an important to understand the how it works and also to understand when and how it fails. Code pertaining to this will be very brief as it isn't incredibly useful or anything you don't know already."

    "## Proportional (P) Control\n",
    "Now we can start getting into the nitty-gritty of control system design. Proportional control is a simple yet effective method for controlling a system. It involves taking a sensor reading, comparing it to an ideal \"reading\", and adjusting an output proportionally based on the difference between the two.\n",

    "As you can see above, we have two sensors contributing to our control system, these photoresistors will be responsible for providing us with feedback that will keep us within the lane lines. Under sensor readings we define what we can expect from the real world input of our sensors to be which is some resistance value. Ideally we want both of these readings to be 1023 (or some constant that refers to the amount of resistance read when the sensors are looking at the white background of the track). When the car starts to veer off course, say to the right, we can expect the right photoresistor voltage reading to decrease. Now let's write some code that uses that information to keep the car within the lines."

    "The proportional control algorithm works by calculating the error between the two readings, which is simply the difference between the left and right readings. If the error is positive, that means the car is too far to the right, so we want to turn the servo to the left to steer the car back towards the center of the track. If the error is negative, that means the car is too far to the left, so we want to turn the servo to the right to steer the car back towards the center of the track. The amount that we turn the servo is proportional to the error. Also note the comment \"The higher the value of KP, the more aggressively the controller will respond to changes in error.\" This means that, the higher KP, the bigger role the error will play in determining our steering angle. This means that if you see the car not turning enough to keep it within the lines using 0.5 for example, then you may need to increase the value. On the other hand, if it is turning too much causing it to start to out of bounds on the opposite side then you may need to decrease the value.\n",

    "PI control is a feedback control strategy that uses two components to correct for error between a desired setpoint and actual process variable. Proportional control is based solely on the current error between the setpoint and actual process variable, while integral control considers the history of the error and integrates it over time.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![integral function continuous](integral_continuous.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the form you are probably most familiar with as it integrates in a continuous manner. However, we are running a program repeatadly in python so we will instead calculate in a discrete manner. This we give us a good estimate as to what our actual integral will come to.\n",
    "\n",
    "![integral function discrete](integral_discrete.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the equation we with to use, let's break it apart and examine what is going on at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, $u(t)$ is will essentially be the steering angle we would like to apply to the servo at each step. $u_bias$ will not be used in our case, however just note that it can be used to reduce variations in $u(t)$ when switching between control states. This specific equation which I screenshotted seems to use the same gain for both proportional and integral components ($K_c$) however we will be using separate gains for each system. So just imagine the next part of this equation is $K_p e(t)$. $K_p$ we remember from before is our proportional gain and $e(t)$ is our error recorded at each time step. Our error remember is just the difference between the values read from the left and right sensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just take a pause now and notice that this step ($K_p e(t)$) is exactly what we did for our P controller. So we can see that a PI controller is literally just adding the integral (I) controller on to our proportional (P) controller. With that in mind, take a look at the summation being performed in place of the integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\tau_I$ is our integral time constant but for us it will just be 1 so we can leave it out. Therefore, we are left with our integral gain times our summation. This very simply is just the value we choose for $K_I$ multiplied by the total error we have accumulated.\n",
    "\n",
